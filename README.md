mydesktop
=========

Uses Docker Compose to run desktop apps.

This allows me to easily keep track of the apps I use on a machine, and to get up and running quickly when I leave my laptop on the train, regardless of the operating system of my new laptop.

To install, do:

```shell
npm install -g markbirbeck/mydesktop
```

Commands can then be run with, for example:

```shell
$ dcr-mutt
```

or:

```shell
$ dcr-jekyll serve
```
